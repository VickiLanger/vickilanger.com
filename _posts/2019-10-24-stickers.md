Last week, I attended [All Things Open 2019](allthingsopen.org "All Things Open Homepage") and made a post about it here. I managed to pick up A LOT of stickers. I mean, who would walk through a building with 100s of booths and not score some swag? Anyway, what I noticed is that some stickers just didn't do their job and others were amazing.

As a business, your goal is to get some ROI on your stickers. You give them away, for free, so people can put them on things and advertise for you. Your sticker will be on some laptop or car and other people are going to see it. That's the point, right? So, your website, your social media, or something that will tell people where to find the maker of the awesome sticker. If you don't, you lose out on valuable marketing.

For example, booths gave these out, but they won't have a longterm return because there's no brand identifier.

I have no clue who did the sticker on the left, but the "test your equipment sticker" was at the Linode booth. Do you see what \[Linode\](linode.com) did right with this sticker? The sticker adds value to the consumer and the sticker is on-brand.

Consumer values can vary. I asked on twitter and got a few different answers.

Basically, if you can improve their life, consumers are more likely to use the sticker. How do you add value to a sticker? Make it useful, make it cute, make it a reminder, make it a list, make it funny, make it support something, and so many other ways that I can't think of. It's also a good idea to allude to what your company does. Sonatype does this with the "automate faster than evil" sticker.

Here are some stickers I grabbed that add value. These will get used, even if a consumer doesn't use the company's product.

Lastly, I should address the name/logo/mascot-only stickers. These are okay if you're a known brand within your category. If you're not as well known as the big companies, you should try a sticker that adds more.
