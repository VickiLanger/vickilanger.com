Earlier this week, I went to the [All Things Open 2019](allthingsopen.org "All Things Open Homepage") conference in Raleigh, NC. My goal was to meet people and learn new things, but I could never have prepared for the things I learned.

## As a new person in tech and a first-time conference-goer

* T-shirts, hoodies, shorts, and other casual clothing is totally acceptable
* Everyone is so welcoming and kind
* I was pronouncing everything wrong
  * Kubernetes (hint: NOT Koo-brrr-neats)
    * K8s (hint: NOT kates)
  * Netlify (tip: it's Net-lif-eye)
  * PostgreSQL (tip: 's' is said twice / hint: NOT post-greh-Es-Queue-Ell or post-greh-Sequel)
  * Azure (hint: NOT a-zoo-er)
  * I'm sure there are more

## Reminders for next time

* Do not wait until 2 days before to book a hotel room
* Make sure to bring a water bottle

## Takeaways from sessions

* Use open-source tools to bootstrap, the big companies are, why wouldn't you
* Avoid burnout! [(ref tweet)](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1184104968053297152  "burnout tweet")
* Allow people to be themselves at work [(ref tweet)](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1183450073058959360 "selves tweet")
* Free admission != access [(ref tweet)](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1183440514772819968 "access tweet")
* The lines between front and backend have blurred over the last few years, hence why I couldn't tell the difference. [(ref tweet)](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1184112325764272128 "blurred lines tweet")
* Machine learning is basically a bunch of if/else statements, I think
* Mentoring can scale and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide#welcome "Kubernetes mentor framework") has a neat framework for it
* Every single person, regardless of our differences, has a place in tech

### Other observations

* Purple hair is in and it looks badass on all sorts of different people
* It seems to be acceptable to be on your phone/computer through entire sessions
* I met a few people from Twitter
* Lego! There were legos on 2 different floors

PS. I'm going to do a separate writeup on what I learned about stickers.
